# ChessGameConsole
A console game of chess that follows blitz chess rules.

This game that I created follows blitz chess rules. In other words, there is no need for either player to say check or checkmate; the
game simply ends when either king is taken.  Since the game is on the console, the player enters his/her moves using algebraic notation. 
For example, "e2e4" moves the pawn on "e2" to "e4", which is a typical starting move in the game of chess. After each move is entered,
if the move is valid, it will be printed as characters on the console; if not, the user is requested to enter a different move.

To run this game, after cloning the repository simply open it with Visual Studio. Then, use Visual Studio's "Start without debugging option" while on "main.cpp" to run the game.
